Instructions
Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold onto all of your work to send to me at the end of the course.

Discussion Questions:
Unit 10 Discussion Post 1: Read this document: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/

1.What are the two most compelling reasons you see to implement Kubernetes in your organization?
2.When the article says Kubernetes is not a PaaS? What do they mean by that? What is a PaaS in comparison?

Unit 10 Discussion Post 2: You get a ticket about your new test cluster. The team is unable to deploy some of their applications. They suspect there is a problem and send you over this output:

[root@Test_Cluster1 ~]# kubectl version
Client Version: v1.31.6+k3s3
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
Server Version: v1.30.6+k3s1
[root@rocky15 ~]# kubectl get nodes
NAME STATUS ROLES AGE VERSION
Test_Cluster1 Ready control-plane,master 17h v1.30.6+k3s1
Test_Cluster2 NotReady worker 33m v1.29.6+k3s1
Test_Cluster3 Ready worker 17h v1.28.6+k3s1

1.What are you checking on the cluster to validate you see their error?
2.What do you think the problem could be?
3.Do you think someone else has tried anything to fix this problem before you? Why or why not?

Unit 10 Discussion Post 3: You are the network operations center (NOC) lead. Your team has recently started supporting the dev, test, and QA environments for your companyâ€™s K8s cluster. Write up a basic checkout procedure for your new NOC personnel to verify operation of the cluster before escalating on critical alerts.
