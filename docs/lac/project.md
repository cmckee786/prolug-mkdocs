Students aiming to complete the Linux Systems Administration course are expected to
devise and complete a capstone project, to be turned in at the end of the course.

The instructions, expectations, and deliverables for the project are listed on this
page.

## Instructions

1. Select a topic to research about a project that you are going to build.

   Topics:

   1. System Stability
   2. System Performance
   3. System Security
   4. System monitoring
   5. Kubernetes
   6. Programming/Automation

2. Plan the project
   - Find documentation or similar projects and build off of what was done there.
3. Document
   - First pass, what does it take to build this?
4. Diagram
   - Draw the thing
     1. [Excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com)
     2. [Draw.io](https://draw.io)
5. Build
   - Get screen shots
   - Make a video?
   - Basically prove you built it.
6. Finalize documentation
   - Redline the documentation
7. Prepare to Present ([overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com/) is a great alternative to Powerpoint)

   - Setup a 15-20 slide deck on what you did
     1. Project purpose
     2. Diagram
     3. Build Process
     4. What did you learn?
     5. How are you going to apply this?

8. Do any of you want to present?
   - Let me (Scott) know and weâ€™ll get you a slot in the last few weeks.

## Deliverables

1. Build Documentation for your project that works in either the ProLUG labs, or in
   the Killercoda environment.

2. A diagram of what you built. This should be both a physical and a logical
   representation of the system (if applicable).

3. Examples of the running system, screen shots, or other proof that you built it and
   show it in a running state.

4. A 15-20 slide presentation of the above material that you would present to a group (presenting
   to us is voluntary, but definitely possible.)
