#### Discussion Post #1

Scan the chapter [here](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html) for keywords and pull out what you think will help you to better understand how to triage an incident.

Read the section called "Operation Security" in this same chapter: [Building Secure and Reliable Systems](https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html)

1. What important concepts do you learn about how we behave during an
   operational response to an incident?

#### Discussion Post #2

Ask Google, find a blog, or ask an AI about high availability. (Here's one if you need it: [AWS Real-Time Communication Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/real-time-communication-on-aws/real-time-communication-on-aws.pdf#high-availability-and-scalability-on-aws)

1. What are some important terms you read about? Why do you think understanding
   HA will help you better in the context of triaging incidents?

## Digging Deeper

1. If uptime is so important to us, why is it so important to us to also understand how our systems can fail? Why would we focus on the thing that does not drive uptime?

2. Start reading about SLOs: [Implementing SLOs](https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/)
   How does this help you operationally?
   Does it make sense that keeping systems within defined parameters will help keep
   them operating longer?

## Reflection Questions

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. How are you going to use what you've learned in your current role?
