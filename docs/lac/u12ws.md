#### Discussion Post #1

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your manager has come to you with another emergency.

He has a meeting next week to discuss capacity planning and usage of the system with IT upper management.
He doesnâ€™t want to lose his budget, but he has to prove that the system utilization warrants spending more.

</blockquote>

1. What information can you show your manager from your systems?

2. What type of data would prove system utilization? (Remember the big 4: compute,
   memory, disk, networking)

3. What would your report look like to your manager?

#### Discussion Post #2

Scenario:

<blockquote>

You are in a capacity planning meeting with a few of the architects.
They have decided to add 2 more agents to your Linus sytems, Bacula Agent and an Avamar Agent.
They expect these agents to run their work starting at 0400 every morning.

</blockquote>

![24 hour view](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b0fbcb-6ac6-402c-8e3f-4c0a39ca858b)

1. What do these agents do? (May have to look them up)

2. Do you think there is a good reason not to use these agents at this timeframe?

3. Is there anything else you might want to point out to these architects about these agents they are installing?

#### Discussion Post #3

Scenario:

<blockquote>

Your team has recently tested at proof of concept of a new
storage system. The vendor has published the blazing fast speeds that are capable of being
run through this storage system. You have a set of systems connected to both the old
storage system and the new storage system.

</blockquote>

1. Write up a test procedure of how you may test these two systems.

2. How are you assuring these test are objective?
   - What is meant by the term Ceteris Paribus, in this context?

## Digging Deeper (optional)

1. Analyzing data may open up a new field of interest to you. Go through some of the  
   free lessons on Kaggle, here: https://www.kaggle.com/learn

   - What did you learn?
   - How will you apply these lessons to data and monitoring you have already  
     collected as a system administrator?

2. Find a blog or article that discusses the 4 types of data analytics.

   - What did you learn about past operations?
   - What did you learn about predictive operations?

3. Download Spyder IDE (Open source).
   - Find a blog post or otherwise try to evaluate some data.
   - Perform some Linear regression. My block of code (but this requires some  
     additional libraries to be added. I can help with that if you need it.)
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
     size = [[5.0], [5.5], [5.9], [6.3], [6.9], [7.5]]
     price =[[165], [200], [223], [250], [278], [315]]
     plt.title('Pizza Price plotted against the size')
     plt.xlabel('Pizza Size in inches')
     plt.ylabel('Pizza Price in cents')
     plt.plot(size, price, 'k.')
     plt.axis([5.0, 9.0, 99, 355])
     plt.grid(True)
     model = LinearRegression()
     model.fit(X = size, y = price)
     #plot the regression line
     plt.plot(size, model.predict(size), color='r')
     ```

## Reflection Questions

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. How can you apply this now in your current role in IT?  
   If youâ€™re not in IT, how can you look to put something like this into your resume or
   portfolio?
