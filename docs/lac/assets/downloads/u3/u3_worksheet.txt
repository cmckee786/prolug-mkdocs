ProLUG 101
Unit 3 Worksheet

Instructions
Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold onto all of your work to send to me at the end of the course.

Discussion Questions:
Unit 3 Discussion Post 1: What does the term triage mean to you? Have you ever had to triage something?
1.	Scan the chapter here https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html for keywords and pull out what you think will help you to better understand how to triage an incident.
2.	Read the section called “Operation Security” in this same chapter: https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch17.html
what important concepts do you learn about how we behave during an operational response to an incident?
Unit 3 Discussion Post 2: 
 Ask google, find a blog, or ask an AI about high availability. (Here’s one if you need it: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/real-time-communication-on-aws/real-time-communication-on-aws.pdf#high-availability-and-scalability-on-aws)
1.	What are some important terms you read about?
2.	Why do you think understanding HA will help you better in the context of triaging incidents?

Lab and Assignment
Unit3_ProLUG_LVM_and_RAID - To be completed outside of lecture time
	Start thinking about your project ideas (more to come in future weeks):
		Topics:
1.	System Stability
2.	System Performance
3.	System Security
4.	System monitoring
5.	Kubernetes
6.	Programming/Automation

You will research, design, deploy, and document a system that improves your administration of Linux systems in some way.
Digging Deeper
1.	If uptime is so important to us, why is it so important to us to also understand how our systems can fail? Why would we focus on the thing that does not drive uptime?

2.	Start reading about SLOs: https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/
How does this help you operationally? Does it make sense that keeping systems within defined parameters will help keep them operating longer?


Reflection Questions
1.	What questions do you still have about this week?


2.	How are you going to use what you’ve learned in your current role?
