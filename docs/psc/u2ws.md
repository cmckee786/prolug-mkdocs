#### Discussion Post #1

There are 401 stigs for RHEL 9. If you filter in your STIG viewer for
`sysctl` there are 33 (mostly network focused), ssh - 39, and network - 58. Now there are
some overlaps between those, but review them and answer these questions

1. As systems engineers why are we focused on protecting the network portion of our
   server builds?
2. Why is it important to understand all the possible ingress points to our servers that
   exist?
   - Why is it so important to understand the behaviors of processes that are
     connecting on those ingress points?

#### Discussion Post #2

Read this: <https://ciq.com/blog/demystifying-and-troubleshooting-name-resolution-in-rocky-linux/>
or similar blogs on DNS and host file configurations.

1. What is the significance of the nsswitch.conf file?

2. What are security problems associated with DNS and common exploits? (May have
   to look into some more blogs or posts for this)

## Digging Deeper

---

1. See if you can find any DNS exploits that have been used and written up in the
   diamond model of intrusion analysis format. If you can, what are the primary actors
   and actions that made up the attack?

## Reflection Questions

---

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. How are you going to use what you've learned in your current role?
